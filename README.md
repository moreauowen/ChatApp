# ChatApp
This is a basic multithreaded TCP chat application with socket programming. A new thread spawns in the server for each incoming TCP connection. Each incoming message is broadcasted to all other currently connected clients. Questions or concerns - contact moreauowen@gmail.com.

Derived from class project for Fall 2019 (Sophomore Year) Network Programming course.
